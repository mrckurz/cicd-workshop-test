# CI/CD Workshop
This simple go program is used to demonstrate how easy a CI/CD pipeline can be setup with GitHub Actions. The subsequent steps are:

1. add the go-code
2. add the GitHub Action Configuration File (/.github/workflows/go.yml). There, the tests shall be executed upon every commit to the main branch
3. Configure Docker and add a Dockerfile
4. create the docker image and push it to Dockerhub
5. add a static SourceCode quality scan (SonarCloud) for monitoring the code quality
6. add a Vulnerability Scanner (Trivy)
